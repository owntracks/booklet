Q: Since updating to Android 6 (or higher), background location reporting does not work as before<br/>
A: Since Android 6 Google has started to restrict background apps. We're doing our best to work against this were we can. 
Your best bet is to enable the ongoing notifications, which enable some background features. HTTP mode works best in the background because it can rely on the OS background scheduling, in contrast to MQTT mode, which requires a persistent TCP connection. 

Q: I've moved, but OwnTracks is not reporting my location<br/>
A: Depending on the mode, the apps report location changes only after significant changes.
